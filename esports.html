        Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a
        form of sport competition using video games. Esports often takes the
        form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly
        between professional players, individually or as teams. Although
        organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture,
        these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when
        participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events
        through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity. By the
        2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with
        many game developers actively designing and providing funding for
        tournaments and other events. <br/> <br/>The most common video game genres
        associated with esports are multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA),
        first-person shooter (FPS), fighting, card, battle royale and real-time
        strategy (RTS) games. Popular esport franchises include League of
        Legends, Dota, Counter-Strike, Overwatch, Street Fighter, Super Smash
        Bros. and StarCraft, among many others. Tournaments such as the League
        of Legends World Championship, Dota 2's International, the fighting
        game-specific Evolution Championship Series (EVO) and Intel Extreme
        Masters are among the most popular in esports.
